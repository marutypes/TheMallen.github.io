## Confoo 2017 Highlights
![Confoo badge](/confoo-badge.png)

I finally made it to a conference outside Ottawa this year. Despite my boyfriend and I coming down with a pretty bad flu, it was a great experience with a diverse array of speakers. There was a lot of really cool content that appealed to me oddly specifically at times.

### Doing a lightning talk about GraphQL
It was fun. I was unprepared. I will not be posting it.

### Web Components / Polymer
I was really excited for Google's [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) when it first came out, even building a large prototype for a client with version 0.5, and I still have a bunch of toy apps on my github that used it. That said, I've found that it's been a bit out of step with the rest of the javascript world since then, with HTML Imports being dropped from specs and the death of 2-way data-binding I found myself drawn back to react land.

I was excited to see that there were a few [cool](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2017/session/decoupling-with-google-polymer) [polymer presentations](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2017/session/web-components-for-micro-services-and-iot) and stories about people using Polymer at scale, and it was brought to my attention that [Polymer 3](https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2017-08-22-npm-modules) promises to bring it closer to the rest of the js ecosystem by embracing npm and es6 modules.

## Machine Learning
I am far from a machine learning expert, which made all of the talks on [Cognitive services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) and [Machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine) in the cloud incredibly interesting to me. I even spent a couple hours implementing a [for-fun app](http://mallorytypes.com/describe-me-cat/) on this blog using Microsoft's Cognitive Services api.

I might play around with it a bit more and see if I can build my own ML model for cat-recognition instead of using the out-the-box one, so check back later to see how it's progressed 😄.

## Getting 💩 done
[David Zuelke](https://twitter.com/dzuelke) of Heroku gave a [talk on the GTD system](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2017/session/how-getting-things-done-saved-my-peace-of-mind) of task management.

It was pretty inspiring and I'll be trying to do some kind of cargo-cult imitation of it using [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com) for a while 😅.

## Asteroid Mining
[Paul Fenwick](https://twitter.com/pjf) gave a [really cool talk on space industry](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2017/session/asteroid-mining-will-space-solve-our-resource-shortage) that I will absolutely not be able to do justice, but it was really cool and you should go look up that stuff right now.

## The City
BC and Vancouver are incredibly beautiful!

## The Food
The food at the conference was absolutely tip top. Pics speak for themselves. I wish I'd remembered to take pictures of more dishes, but I just ate them too fast.
